# 📌 About me

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’m in my third year and have recently developed an interest in Data Science 📊 and Machine Learning 🤖. Outside of academics, I enjoy swimming and reading fiction  

Fun Fact
- I actually hate coding… but here I am, still learning to do it 😅.
- I have a soft spot for watermelons 🍉🍉 — and if a career in tech doesn’t work out, I might just become a watermelon farmer 👩‍🌾.
